**Historical Information:** It was believed that there lived a monk named Saint Nicholas. Who was a big man with a big heart. He would often give away all this wealth and possessions to the ones who were needy. There are many stories of Saint Nicholas generosity. One that stands popular is the one where he saved three poor sisters from being sold into slavery by their father, by giving them 3 bags full of money. When Saint Nicholas died, it was believed that people saw angels around him to guide his way to heaven. Even after his death, people continued the practice of giving gifts. Slowly and steadily, his popularity spread across all borders. And that’s how we got our Santa Claus!
